        <ul>
            <li>
                The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign 'Teddy's bear' and left it in their shop window.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.
